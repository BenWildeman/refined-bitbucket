# refined-bitbucket
We all know Bitbucket lacks some features that we find lovely in GitHub and in our minds.
And based on Sindre Sorhus' [Refined Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github)
extension I had the idea of improving BitBucket's user interface.
In fact, [Rodrigo Proença](https://github.com/rproenca) did most of the initial code and I just created the extension
and made a few improvements. Kudos!

## Current features
- Improves syntax highlight for pull requests. Enabled languages:
  - Markup, C-like languages, Go, Groovy, Bash, Handlebars, JSON, Markdown, Python, React JSX, Ruby, PHP, Scala, Less, Sass, Swift and YAML. I decided to add the most common languages, but it can be easily improved if necessary.
- Double click on a word to highlight all occurrences.
- Block pull request merging without a minimum number of approvals (defaults to 2 minimum approvals).
